# Movie Recommendation Systems

In this mini-project, I developed two simple movie recommendation systems using **(1) content-based filtering**, which recommends movies similar in genre as those rated highly by the user, and **(2) collaborative filtering**, which recommends movies rated highly by other users with similar inputs, i.e., movies watched and rated.
