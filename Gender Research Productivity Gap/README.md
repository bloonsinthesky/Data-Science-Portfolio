# Gender Research Productivity Gap


## Background
This markdown contains the R scripts I used to **visualize the gender productivity gap in STEM and other scientific fields**. Note that this data was collected as part of my PhD dissertation at the George Washington University. In addition, a study based on my dissertation research was published in *Journal of Applied Psychology* in 2018: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/apl0000331>. Accordingly, a detailed discussion of all of the samples, procedures, and measures, in addition to study findings and theoretical perspectives, are included in the published article.

## Data and Sample
I collected research productivity data on individual researchers in the Mathematics, Genetics, Applied Psychology, and Mathematical Psychology fields. The samples included every researcher **who published at least one article** in one of the **top 5 most influential journals** (i.e., most highly cited journals) in his or her respective field during the 10-year time window **from 2006 to 2015**. For each individual in the sample, I measured **research productivity** by counting the total number of papers he or she published in those same top-tier journals during the same time period from 2006 to 2015. The sample sizes were as follows: 

* Study 1 included 3,853 researchers who published 3,161 articles in mathematics.
* Study 2 included 45,007 researchers who published 7,746 articles in genetics.
* Study 3 included 4,081 researchers who published 2,807 articles in applied psychology and 6,337 researchers who published 3,796 articles in mathematical psychology.

## Data Visualization Process
To examine the magnitude of the gender productivity gap, I first performed visual comparisons of the productivity distributions by gender. This visual inspection was the first step of the examination, and it was then followed by more advanced statistical analyses of each distribution's properties (not included in this markdown)â€”again, these analyses are explained at full length in the published article.

I visualized each gender's productivity distributions using **histograms** and **kernel density plots**. Overall, findings revealed that **there was a considerable gender productivity gap among stars in favor of men** across fields. Specifically, the under-representation of women was more extreme at the more elite ranges of performance (i.e., right tails of the distributions).
