# Data-Science-Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of my data science and analytics projects completed for professional, research, and learning purposes. Projects are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, R markdown files (published at RPubs), and dashboards (published at Tableau Public, IBM Cloud, and Heroku), in addition to written reports and powerpoint slides.
