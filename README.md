# Data-Science-Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of my data science and analytics projects completed for professional, research, and learning purposes. Projects are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, R markdown files (published at RPubs), online dashboard apps, written reports, powerpoint slides, and video lectures.

Data files for all projects are available in their respective folders or, in the case of large data files, via a URL within the Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are best viewed using the *nbviewer* links provided.

## Contents

+ ### Machine Learning
  + [The Battle of the Neighborhoods](https://github.com/bloonsinthesky/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/The%20Battle%20of%20the%20Neighborhoods): *K*-means __clustering__ was used to cluster all neighborhoods in Helsinki based on a selection of neighborhood features. The "optimal" neighborhood cluster for opening a new caf√© was then chosen using a set of business and mathematical assumptions. Neighborhood census and venue data were collected from *Statistics Finland* and via the *Foursquare* API, and then cleaned using SQL queries and pandas.

  + [Predicting House Sale Prices Using Regression](https://github.com/bloonsinthesky/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Predicting%20House%20Sale%20Prices%20Using%20Regression): A series of **regression** models predicting house sale prices were developed and compared. Model instances with varying polynomial degrees, regularization types (i.e., ridge, lasso, elastic net), and extreme gradient boosting were compared using *R*<sup>2</sup> and RMSE scores. All hyperparameters were tuned using 5-fold **cross validation** and Bayesian optimization.

I collected publication data by individual researchers in the *Mathematics*, *Genetics*, *Applied Psychology*, and *Mathematical Psychology* fields, then **compared the productivity distributions by gender** using histograms and kernel density plots. Note that this data was collected as part of my PhD dissertation, and a study based on my dissertation research was published in *Journal of Applied Psychology*.

+ ### Teaching About Data
  Since 2019, I have been the responsible teacher for the master's course *Doing Quantitative Research* at Aalto University School of Business. In 2020, due to the pandemic, the course was conducted fully online via pre-recorded lectures and live Zoom sessions. 
  
  Below are five pre-recorded lectures from 2020:
  
  + Main Lecturer
    + [Logistic Regression, Mediation, and Moderation](https://aalto.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=bcfed629-80b2-4c56-b2d3-acb600eb97a9)
    + [Fundamentals of Survey Resarch](https://aalto.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1a568a28-4dd2-410a-9856-ad4800b46411)
    + [Introduction to IBM SPSS](https://aalto.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=08f27ca7-493c-4078-855b-acb600eb986e)
    
  + Secondary Lecturer
    + [Assumptions of Linear Regression](https://aalto.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=10962a91-ba43-4c0f-828a-ad4800b6ade4)
    + [Research Design](https://aalto.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0b8ad79a-e0e8-41c5-b052-ad4800b6bec3) 
  
I've also been involved in numerous **academic research** projects in which I performed the leading role in data collection, data analysis, paper writing, and presenting. In my research, I use statistical techniques frequently utilized in the social sciences but less common in data science, such as *structural equation modeling*, *multilevel modeling*, *allometric modeling*, and *social network analysis* on survey and randomized experiment data sets. You can view these outputs in a separate repository: [Academic Publications and Presentations](https://github.com/bloonsinthesky/academic-papers-and-presentations)
