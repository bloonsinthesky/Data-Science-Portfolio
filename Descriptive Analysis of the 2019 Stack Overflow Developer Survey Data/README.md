# Descriptive Analysis of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data

I examined data collected as part of the **2019 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey**. In this analysis, a subset of the full 2019 dataset (approximately 10% of the original dataset; *N* = 11,398) was analyzed and visualized using *SQL*, *Python* and *IBM Cognos*. The findings yielded numerous insights into developer technology usage, trends, and demographics. 

These insights are particularly relevant to current and prospective developers aiming to remain competitive; businesses aiming to upskill their talent; educators in the field; and policy makers aiming to address gender, economic, and technological issues.
